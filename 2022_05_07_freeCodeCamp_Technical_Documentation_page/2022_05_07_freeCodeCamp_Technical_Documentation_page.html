                <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as
                    few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended
                    to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on
                    all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically
                    compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying
                    computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level
                    facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection
                    and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.
                    As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to
                    GitHub, particularly for client–server web applications, with a reported 9 million
                    developers.</p>

                <p>Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in May 1995 as a core
                    component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java
                    compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary
                    licenses.</p>

                <p>James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June
                    1991. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the
                    digital cable television industry at the time. The language was initially called Oak after an
                    oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was
                    finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia. Gosling designed Java
                    with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.</p>

                <p>Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996. It promised write
                    once, run anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly
                    secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major
                    web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly
                    became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly
                    with the Java 1.0 language specification. With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE
                    1.2 in December 1998 – 1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of
                    platforms.</p>

                <p>Sun has defined and supports four editions of Java targeting different application environments and
                    segmented many of its APIs so that they belong to one of the platforms. The platforms are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Java Card for smart-cards.</li>
                    <li>Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME) – targeting environments with limited resources.</li>
                    <li>Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) – targeting workstation environments.</li>
                    <li>Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) – targeting large distributed enterprise or Internet
                        environments.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The classes in the Java APIs are organized into separate groups called packages. Each package
                    contains a set of related interfaces, classes, subpackages and exceptions.</p>

                <p>Sun also provided an edition called Personal Java that has been superseded by later, standards-based
                    Java ME configuration-profile pairings.</p>

                <p>One design goal of Java is portability, which means that programs written for the Java platform must
                    run similarly on any combination of hardware and operating system with adequate run time support.
                    This is achieved by compiling the Java language code to an intermediate representation called Java
                    bytecode, instead of directly to architecture-specific machine code. Java bytecode instructions are
                    analogous to machine code, but they are intended to be executed by a virtual machine (VM) written
                    specifically for the host hardware. End-users commonly use a Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
                    installed on their device for standalone Java applications or a web browser for Java applets.</p>

                <p>Standard libraries provide a generic way to access host-specific features such as graphics,
                    threading, and networking.</p>

                <p>The use of universal bytecode makes porting simple. However, the overhead of interpreting bytecode
                    into machine instructions made interpreted programs almost always run more slowly than native
                    executables. Just-in-time (JIT) compilers that compile byte-codes to machine code during runtime
                    were introduced from an early stage. Java's Hotspot compiler is actually two compilers in one; and
                    with GraalVM (included in e.g. Java 11, but removed as of Java 16) allowing tiered compilation.</p>

            <article>
                <p>The syntax of Java is largely influenced by C++ and C. Unlike C++, which combines the syntax for
                    structured, generic, and object-oriented programming, Java was built almost exclusively as an
                    object-oriented language. All code is written inside classes, and every data item is an object,
                    with the exception of the primitive data types, (i.e. integers, floating-point numbers, boolean
                    values, and characters), which are not objects for performance reasons. Java reuses some popular
                    aspects of C++ (such as the printf method).</p>

                <p>Unlike C++, Java does not support operator overloading or multiple inheritance for classes, though
                    multiple inheritance is supported for interfaces.</p>

                <p>Java uses comments similar to those of C++. There are three different styles of comments: a single
                    line style marked with two slashes (//), a multiple line style opened with /* and closed with */,
                    and the Javadoc commenting style opened with /** and closed with */. The Javadoc style of commenting
                    allows the user to run the Javadoc executable to create documentation for the program and can be
                    read by some integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Eclipse to allow developers to
                    access documentation within the IDE.</p>

                <p>The traditional Hello world program can be written in Java as:</p>
                <p>
                    <code>public class HelloWorldApp {<br>
                        public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
                            System.out.println("Hello World!"); // Prints the string to the console.<br>
                        }<br>
                    }</code>
                </p>

                <h3>Example with methods</h3>
                <p><code>// This is an example of a single line comment using two slashes

                    /*<br>
